# Convert files

A set of terminal functions to convert files (mostly images) and fix some common issues (like bounding boxes).

## Getting Started

Download the repository and add to your bashrc / zshrc / cshrc the line :

```
source /PATH/TO/FILETOOLS/file_tools.env
```

### Prerequisites

Depending on the script used, you will need some additional tools that you can classically download using `brew install` if you are on macOS.

## It works on my computer

But don't blame me if it doesn't on yours :)
